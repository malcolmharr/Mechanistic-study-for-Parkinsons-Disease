#First, install mdtraj with anaconda in an environment w/ Python 3.4+

conda install -c conda-forge mdtraj

#To test the installation, use the following commands:

pip install pytest
pytest mdtraj -v

#Now, you are ready to convert your trajectory files. Activate the conda environment containing mdtraj and run the following command:

python mdconvert.py

#To convert your NAMD psf file to GROMACS topology, switch your environment back to gmx_MMPBSA first

conda actiavte gmx_MMPBSA

#Then, use ParmEd to convert your psf file to gromacs topology. Ensure that all of your parameters are defined in the psf2top.py file

python activate psf2top.py
